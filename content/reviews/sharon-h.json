  "review": "I needed an old refrigerator and other items removed from my garage and attic. JC Removal was recommended to me by a friend.  I called and discussed my needs and JC Removal was at my house within 3 days.  They arrived on time and got the job done quickly.  I was very happy with their services, and I will be using them again."
